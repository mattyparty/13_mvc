# Project Name: MVC

# Project Description

Created a MVC/Full Stack Wep app using Handlebars and Mysql. I am quickly learning that managing differnt files is very key in web development. With ORM its a little tricky to manage. Especially with a connection file on one end and the routes on the other. I am hopefull that using sequelize in the upcomming projects will help to stream line this a bit.

# Assingment Feedback
